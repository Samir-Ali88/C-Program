<h1> My C Programming Journey</h1>
Welcome to my C programming project repository — a personal space where I explore and practice the C language after starting with Python.

This repository marks the beginning of my journey into low-level programming, where I dive into core concepts like memory management, logic building, and structured programming using C.

<h1> What to Expect</h1>
Well-structured, beginner-friendly C programs

Each project includes meaningful logic and real use-cases

Clean, commented code written as part of my learning process

Progressive improvements as I explore new C features

<h1> Why This Repo?</h1>
After building confidence in Python, I wanted to challenge myself with a new language that teaches deeper control of system-level programming. This repo is my learning log — every file is a step forward.

<h1> Tools & Technologies</h>

Language: C
Compiler: GCC

Editor: Code::Blocks / VS Code / any other editor

Feel free to explore, learn, and follow my journey!
This is just the beginning — more to come as I grow.
